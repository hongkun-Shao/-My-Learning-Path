# beginning
it is the begin of my learning
1. I want to join the open source community, so in  April 2023, I will learn the basic operation of git and the basic operation mechanism of github, and find the learning foundation of the community of interest.
2. I am learning web-server on Linux now, if you are interested in it, welcome to take a talk.(update: I have finished the tiny http_server, 2023/05/01)
3. I plan to participate in the OSPP and have an interest in StarRocks, so I am learning the knowledge related to ORC, DB in May 2023. If you are interested in it, welcome to take a talk.(update: Unfortunately, I didn't win the first place and my chances of winning have greatly decreased.
